👨‍⚕️ Online doctor appointment project is the web application
   which helps customers/patients to online reserve a term at the doctor's place.
   Customers have the ability to register and enter their valid health card credentials in order to create their profile.
   Customers are also offered to see appointment logs and health documentation as well as communicating with their family doctor.
   In return, doctors are able to see which patients have scheduled an appointment and at what time as well as the health and medicine documentation. 
   The purpose of this web application is to save time and effort for both doctors and patients and keep the health service on point and organized.
